# How to compile
Run `npm install` and `node index.js` to render both tmTheme and vscode varients.

# IntelliJ
It should be noted taht the IntelliJ file (.icls) is not generated from a .tmTheme file. This is due to too many scopt changes between editors. Instead, the IntelliJ varient is tracked seperately and has slightly different scope colors. There is not a 1:1 match of scope between editors.
